# Abstract Factory Pattern for the Creation of Characters, Weapons and Shields

This project is an implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern, which provides an elegant and efficient way to create families of objects related or dependent on each other. We use the Abstract Factory pattern for the creation of characters, weapons and shields in a video game, giving more code. clean and organized and the flexibility to easily extend it in the future.

## Main Features

- **Character Creation**: The Abstract Factory pattern allows us to create various types of characters in a coherent and organized way. You can add new hero types with ease, while maintaining clean and sustainable code.

- **Configurable Weapons and Shields**: Not only are heroes created, but we also configure their weapons and shields. This provides extreme flexibility in creating unique and exciting characters.

- **Ease of Extension**: The design is designed so that you can add new types of heroes, weapons and shields without negatively affecting the existing parts of the code. The Abstract Factory pattern ensures that everything continues to run smoothly.
